# What sets Nix apart? (1/3)

* Software is built in a hermetic, 100% reproducible environment
* Nix vs Docker:
    * Docker just guarantees that you can pass around the built images
    A Dockerfile might build successfully today and then fail tomorrow e.g. due to internet resources disappearing or the base image changing in an incompatible way
    * Nix guarantees that *both* the build process and resulting artifacts are reproducible.

---

# What sets Nix apart? (2/3)

* You can create deterministic development environments (without the awkwardness of developing inside of a container or VM)
    * You can lock specific versions of dev tools, C/C++ dependencies, etc
    * This applies per project; there is absolutely zero conflict with having one version used by one project and completely different version used in another project
* Superior visibility into the dependencies of your software (and your system as a whole)

---

# What sets Nix apart? (3/3)

* With NixOS, *the entire system state is reproducible*
    * Systemd services
    * Installed software
    * Network config
* A given NixOS config (with no changes) can be used for:
    * Network boot (iPXE)
    * Creating bootable ISOs
    * Installing on bare metal
    * Deployment to cloud providers
